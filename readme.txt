This is a beginner-friendly project created as part of my learning journey on freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

It was my first hands-on experience with CSS, and the goal was to practice how CSS styles interact with HTML structure. Through this project, I explored various CSS tools such as:

Font styling

Text alignment

Box model basics

Pseudo-selectors

Class-based styling

The HTML portion includes a simple menu layout with sections for coffee and desserts, while the CSS adds visual polish and structure to the page.

This project helped me understand how design and content work together on the web, and it marks an exciting first step in my journey to becoming a fullstack developer.

Feel free to explore the code and see how it all comes together!
